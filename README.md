# 🌍 Global Sales Analysis 

##  Executive Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive global sales performance analysis**, developed using **Tableau** for visualization and **Excel** for data preparation.  
It highlights revenue distribution, profit margins, and regional growth patterns through interactive dashboards and calculated insights.

## Project Objective
To transform scattered global sales data into a **clear, interactive decision-making tool** that enables stakeholders to:
- Monitor sales and profitability across regions and categories  
- Identify top-performing markets and emerging opportunities  
- Detect trends in losses and underperforming zones for corrective actions  

##  Data Preparation & Integration
- Utilized **Microsoft Excel** for **data cleaning and transformation** — removed inconsistencies, standardized formats, and prepared structured tables.  
- Ensured **data accuracy and integrity** before importing into Tableau.  
- Created calculated columns and pre-aggregated metrics to improve Tableau performance and reduce loading time.  

##  Tableau Dashboard Design
- Developed a **multi-layered interactive dashboard** in Tableau focusing on:  
  -  **Regional Sales & Profit Distribution**  
  -  **Top and Bottom Performing Markets**
